## Initializing a Qiling instance
Emulating a program or shellcode using Qiling requires a Qiling instance. Most of the emulation parameters and operations are controlled via that instance, which is commonly named `ql`. The arguments used to initialize a Qiling instance may differ based on the emulated target.

### Initialization arguments for binary emulation

| Name                     | Type                             | Description
| :--                      | :--                              | :--
| `argv`                   | `Sequence[str]`                  | a sequence of command line arguments to emulate
| `rootfs`                 | `str`                            | the emulated filesystem root directory. all paths accessed by the emulated program will be based on this directory
| `env` (optional)         | `MutableMapping[AnyStr, AnyStr]` | a dictionary of environment variables available for the emualted program

Notes:
 - Qiling will automaticaly infer the target OS and architecture based on the target program
 - Using the hosting system root directory as emulation rootfs is considered a bad practice and it is strictly **not recommended**

### Initialization arguments for shellcode emulation

| Name                     | Type       | Description
| :--                      | :--        | :--
| `code`                   | `bytes`    | shellcode to emulate. that comes instead of `argv`
| `rootfs` (optional)      | `str`      | _refer to above table_
| `ostype`                 | `QL_OS`    | sets target operating system: `LINUX`, `FREEBSD`, `MACOS`, `WINDOWS`, `UEFI`, `DOS`, `QNX`, `MCU`, or `BLOB`
| `archtype`               | `QL_ARCH`  | sets target architecture: `X86`, `X8664`, `ARM`, `ARM64`, `MIPS`, `A8086`, `CORTEX_M'`, `RISCV`, `RISCV64` or `PPC`
| `endian` (optional)      | `bool`     | indicates architecture endianess (relevant only to ARM and MIPS)
| `thumb` (optional)       | `bool`     | indicates ARM thumb mode (relevant only to ARM)

### Common initialization arguments

| Name                      | Type                    | Description
| :--                       | :--                     | :--
| `cputype` (optional)      | `QL_CPU`                | sets the underlying CPU model. this is used to make sure certain architectural features are available
| `verbose` (optional)      | `QL_VERBOSE`            | sets Qiling logging verbosity level (default: `QL_VERBOSE.DEFAULT`). for more details see [print section](https://docs.qiling.io/en/latest/print/)
| `profile` (optional)      | `str`                   | path to profile file holding additional settings. for more details see [profile section](https://docs.qiling.io/en/latest/profile/)
| `log_devices` (optional)  | `Collection[IO \| str]` | determines logging output devices: file streams and names are both supported. by default logging output goes to `stderr`
| `log_override` (optional) | `Logger`                | used to override the default logger with a custom one
| `log_plain` (optional)    | `bool`                  | indicates whether logger output should be colorful or plain. by default this is determined by the target log device and whether it supports colors
| `multithread` (optional)  | `bool`                  | indicates whether the target should be emulated as a multi-threaded program
| `libcache` (optional)     | `bool`                  | indicates whether libraries should be loaded from cache. this saves libraries parsing and relocating time on consequent runs. currently available only for Windows programs

## Configuring the emulation environment
During its initialization Qiling infers the target OS and architecture, which now may be configured as necessary.

Here are a few common examples:

`ql.add_fs_mapper`  
Used to map a path on the hosting system to a virtual path, so it become available to the emulated program. This can be used in various ways, including mapping objects to emulate 'dynamic' file contents. For example, mapping `/dev/random` to the host's `/dev/zero` to cause the emulated program read only zeros when it reaches the file for a random value:
```python
ql.add_fs_mapper(r'/dev/random', r'/dev/zero')
```

`ql.patch`  
Used to patch a loaded module in memory, either main program or library. This can be used to override code or modify data to allow emulation to get to certain code flows that need to be tested. For example, overriding a certain address with a nop-sled (assuming x86 architecture):
```python
ql.patch(0x401100, b'\x90' * 8)
```

`ql.debugger`  
Set a debugger to be used during the emulation session. For details please refer to the [debugger](https://docs.qiling.io/en/latest/debugger/) page


## Emulation controls
After initializing and configuring Qiling, it is time to start emulation. The emulation starts simply with:
```python
ql.run()
```

Where a finer-grained control is required, use the following optional arguments as needed:
 - `begin` - determine the emulation starting address. this is the address of the first instruction that gets emulated
 - `end` - determine the emulation exit address; the emulation will stop upon reaching that address
 - `timeout` - max emulation time (in microseconds)
 - `count` - max emulation steps; the emulation will stop after emulating that many instructions

Note: Setting a `begin` and `end` addresses is useful when coming to focus the emulation on a specific flow or jump over unnecessary pieces of code (e.g. when fuzzing a specific function). In such case, make sure to manually initialize the necessarey context (e.g. function parameters) beforehand to compensate for the code that used to do that but now is being skipped.

## Examples
A few examples are exhibited in this document and we will illustrate how Qiling Framework works.

### Emulating a binary
```python
from qiling import Qiling
from qiling.const import QL_VERBOSE

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # set up command line argv and emulated os root path
    argv = r'examples/rootfs/netgear_r6220/bin/mini_httpd -d /www -r NETGEAR R6220 -c **.cgi -t 300'.split()
    rootfs = r'examples/rootfs/netgear_r6220'

    # instantiate a Qiling object using above arguments and set emulation verbosity level to DEBUG.
    # additional settings are read from profile file
    ql = Qiling(argv, rootfs, verbose=QL_VERBOSE.DEBUG, profile='netgear.ql')

    # map emulated fs '/proc' dir to the hosting os '/proc' dir
    ql.add_fs_mapper('/proc', '/proc')
  
    # do the magic!
    ql.run()
```

Content of the netgear.ql profile file:
```ini
[MIPS]
mmap_address = 0x7f7ee000
```

### Emulating a shellcode
```python
from qiling import Qiling
from qiling.const import QL_ARCH, QL_OS, QL_VERBOSE

# set up a shellcode to emulate
shellcode = bytes.fromhex('''
